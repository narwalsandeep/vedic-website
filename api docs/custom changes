[Our History]
Established in 1971, the Vedic Society of Southampton began with a group of dedicated Hindus eager to preserve Sanatana Dharma. From humble home gatherings to celebrations in a Northam Church Hall, our journey reached a milestone on 11 August 1984, with the joyous inauguration of the Vedic Society Hindu Temple - a testament to our enduring commitment to traditions and community.

[Our Belief]
At the Vedic Society Hindu Temple, we cherish Hindu Sanskriti. Rooted in the ancient Indus Valley, our diverse beliefs draw from the sacred Vedas. Hindus believe that each person is intrinsically divine and the purpose of life is to seek and realize the divinity within all of us. Our celebrations, including Diwali and Holi, reflect our commitment to keeping Hindu traditions alive.

[Our Community]
In Southampton, our diverse Hindu community, numbering in the thousands, finds a vibrant hub in our Temple. From India, Nepal, East Africa, and beyond, we unite during festivals and activities, creating a close-knit, lively community.
